# Technical Writing Video Resource
HeyðŸ˜Š...glad you found the need the check out my carefully curated video resources for technical writers. I'm guessing you're a beginner? Or someone who's curious about this field and want to get into it. I'm also guesssing you're a visual learner--like myself (you learn better through videos, diagrams and infographics. You'd prefer this anyday over reading boring long texts, courses and blog posts.)

Don't get me wrong, reading texts are a great way to learn, and very important to us as technical writers since we will be working with documentation and in many cases have to draw inspiration from existing written documentation. 

Still, if I had my way, i'll create a video version of every piece of documentation I create (just kiddingðŸ¤ª).

Don't judge me!! I just prefer watching vidoes to learn about a product or a concept. If I needed to go in-depth, then, a written document makes more sense in that case.

If you are like me, and want to explore the world of technical writing by watching helpful videos, this is the right resource for you! You're welcome! 

Below are top curated technical writing videos for beginners, in no particular order (ignore the numbered lists).

Check out the video [here](https://youtu.be/t5Dq6GnQwTo?si=4am3nV8cWEF-olwR). 
10. **Types of Technical Writing:** A common mistake I have seen many new technical writers, and even experienced technical writers make is assume there's only a particular type of technical writing, or that a certain form of technical writing isn't technical writing if it "doesn't include code snippets" or follow a particular technical writing style they are used to seeing or working with. 

    I have seen people shy away from technical writing due to this biased and one-sided assessment of technical writing as a field. 

    Fortunately, I found a video resource that teaches newbies the various types of technical writing they can explore. This video titled "**Types of Technical Writing**" breaks down the different types of technical writing and what they look like.
