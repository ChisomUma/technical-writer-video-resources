# Technical Writing Video Resource
Hey, ðŸ˜Š...glad you found the need to check out my carefully curated video resources for technical writers. I'm guessing you're a beginner? Or someone curious about this field and wants to get into it. I'm also guessing you're a visual learner--like myself (you learn better through videos, diagrams, and infographics. You'd prefer this any day over reading boring long texts, courses, and blog posts.)

Don't get me wrong, reading texts is a great way to learn, and it is very important to us as technical writers since we will be working with documentation and, in many cases, have to draw inspiration from existing written documentation. 

Still, if I had my way, I'd create a video version of every piece of documentation I create (just kiddingðŸ¤ª).

Don't judge me! I prefer watching videos to learn about a product or concept. However, if I needed to go in-depth, a written document would make more sense.

If you are like me and want to explore the world of technical writing by watching helpful videos, this is the right resource for you! You're welcome! 

Below are top curated technical writing videos for beginners, in no particular order (ignore the numbered lists).

1. **What is the Technical Writer Career Path?**: My first on the list is this beginner's guide to technical writing from [Technical Writer HQ](https://technicalwriterhq.com/). The video titled "**What is the Technical Writer Career Path?**" introduces you to the concept of technical writing, what the day-to-day of a junior technical writer looks like, and salary expectations. Check out the video [here](https://youtu.be/RZF34wQEv0Y?si=0-AA1AEpzPeNntxZ).

2. **What do Technical Writers do? (Also, what is Technical Writing?)**: This a very useful video resource I found from one of my favorite technical writers. Her name is **Amruta Ranade**, and you need to give her a follow on YouTube if you're seriously interested in learning more about technical writing. The video titled "**What do Technical Writers do? (Also, what is Technical Writing?)**" explains what technical writers generally do. It's a short 4-minute video, so it shouldn't take much of your time. It's pretty straightforward and hits the nail on the head. Check out the video [here](https://youtu.be/biocrCx5T_k?si=kM_2MRzhc0A8gltk).

3. **Technical Writing Beginners // Advice and Resources:** This is another interesting watch for the curious technical writer noobs ðŸ˜‰. Again, from Amruta, you get a series of helpful advice and resources to help you kickstart your journey in technical writing. The video titled "**Technical Writing Beginners // Advice and Resources**" gives you the best bits of advice on how to navigate this field. Check out the video [here](https://youtu.be/JHm3kVMITmI?si=n_IFuEzqv-8XApf-).

Check out the video [here](https://youtu.be/ez_bvYvfa_E?si=FqCi4MMZZDxF3iM-).

5. **How to Become a Freelance Technical Writer**: You have learned about technical writing and its career part but don't know how to get started and earn some cash. The video titled "**How to Become a Freelance Technical Writer**" shows you how to dive into the world of freelance technical writing.

Check out the video [here](https://youtu.be/mJbBx8FCN3A?si=tOmyupzupENE3m_I).

6. **Edit Open Source Documents with me // Technical Writing vlog:** One challenge newbie technical writers face is creating documentation writing samples and building real-world experience. I'll tell you this for free!! The answer is open-source. With open source, you get to contribute to real-world documentation efforts. And show this as samples to hiring managers. Open source teaches you how to collaborate with SMEs, in additiion to improving your writing. 

    The video titled "**Edit Open Source Documents with me // Technical     Writing vlog**" shows you how to edit an open source project. This video is particularly helpful to new technical writers who already have a basic understanding of open source. Not to worry if you don't already have an idea of open-source, you can check out this [video to learn more](https://youtu.be/RGd5cOXpCQw?si=oWmGeWJu2gkOcIKL).

7. **Essential Tools for Technical Writers:** This video talks about essential tools you'll likely use as a technical writer. You don't have to learn these tools immediately, but it's nice to know that they exist and should be factored into your learning path when going more in-depth into the field of technical writing. The video titled "**Essential Tools for Technical Writers**" goes through some of these tools. Check out the video [here](https://youtu.be/Y1m33rgybj8?si=4Zrt0H45gvn_624-).
8. **Company style guide in technical writing: What is it? How to create one?:** Style guides are a set of rules that help keep the documentation consistent and of high quality. The video titled "**Company style guide in technical writing: What is it? How to create one?**" explains what a style guide is and how it's used in documentation. Check out the video [here](https://youtu.be/ff2h22K4hqI?si=ZB7YN_JGDWWnyix5).
9. **UX Writing in 60 seconds!:** Part of your job as a technical writer may involve UX (user experience) writing. UX writing is a big part of technical writing. This video titled "**UX Writing in 60 seconds!**" explores this concept and how you can get started with it in 60 seconds!! Check out the video [here](https://youtu.be/t5Dq6GnQwTo?si=4am3nV8cWEF-olwR). 
10. **Types of Technical Writing:** A common mistake I have seen many new technical writers and even experienced technical writers make is assuming there's only a particular type of technical writing or that a certain form of technical writing isn't technical writing if it "doesn't include code snippets" or follow a particular technical writing style they are used to seeing or working with. 

    I have seen people shy away from technical writing due to this biased and one-sided assessment of technical writing as a field. 

    Fortunately, I found a video resource that teaches newbies the various types of technical writing they can explore. This video titled "**Types of Technical Writing**" breaks down the different types of technical writing and what they look like. Check out the video [here](https://youtu.be/QCjiBGK2PCA?si=Vww2qaJht2eeIqoM).
    
I hope these resources have purposefully been able to introduce you to the world of technical writing.
